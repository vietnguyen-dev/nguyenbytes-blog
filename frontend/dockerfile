# Step 1: Build the application using Node 20
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies

# Copy the build output from the build stage to Nginx's public directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port that the Nginx server will run on
EXPOSE 3000
